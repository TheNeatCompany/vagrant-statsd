Statsd is run under a \"statsd\" system user.\n\nBy default statsd will attempt to send statistics to a graphite instance running on localhost, which\ncan be configured using the Graphite cookbook at http://community.opscode.com/cookbooks/graphite.\n\n= CAVEATS:\n\nThis cookbook has only been tested on Ubuntu Natty (11.04).
